									<p>Student number s3763539.<br><br></p>
									<p> I was born in Australia and grew up in Melbourne and Bendigo. My hobbies can change depending on where I am living. But I do like to read crime novels to turn off my brain at night and engage in gardening to relax. I like IT as I find it challenging and it is always changing. My background in IT is that I started in telecommunications and moved into mainframe peripherals, then Netware servers. I then moved into networking with my last position as a senior consultant in a global network engineering team. </p>

							<p>My name is Joshua William Telfer and I was born on the 19th of July 1999 to my parents Robert and Joanne. I am the eldest of four brothers and despite my parents both having brown and black hair, I came out a ginger (lucky). I was raised in a typical middle class Australian home, having completed year 12 in 2017 and then moving straight into full time work. Going through high school, I loved rowing and found myself joining the school rowing team.

								<h1>David Jelbart</h1>
							</header>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic11.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>I was born in Australia and grew up in Werribee and Hoppers Crossing, having moved only one block in my life time. I have many hobbies but my primary one is video game playing, however I am also an avid book reader, and will play games with my dogs as well. I.T. is something that has interested me since childhood, a lot of my interest coming from my father. My background in I.T. is from the I.T. electives I took in high school and the working together on DIY I.T. home solutions with friends, usually being home servers or NAS.</p>

							<p></p>
							<p>I was born in Australia and spent much of my life in Warrandyte on the Yarra river however now am living in Fitzroy. My main hobbies are surfing, snowboarding, riding however I also enjoy the more relaxing pleasures of life as I love to read as well as bake. If I am being truthful, IT has never been something I consider myself particularly interested in however this class as an elective has sparked an interest which I would like to grow further. My experience within IT comes mainly from my own business which operates partially on the online market, so this has required me to increase my skills and understanding to best operate my business.</p>
